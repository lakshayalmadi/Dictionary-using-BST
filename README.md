# Dictionary-using-BST

The aim of this project is to implement dictionary using relevant data structures in C programming language. Using this program, the user must be able to store words in the dictionary along with their meanings and it should be easy to search the meanings of those words when needed.

## Proposed operations

* INSERT: to enter words and their meanings in the BST 
* SEARCH: to search for specific words in the BST
* DELETE: to remove a word and its meaning from the BST
* TRAVERSE: to display all the elements present in the BST in lexicographical order
* UPDATE: to update the meaning of an already entered word.
